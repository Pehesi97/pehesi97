## Beyond Tech: My Other Passions

In addition to my professional career, I have a deep passion for **motorsport** and **music**.

I’m currently preparing for the day when I can translate the knowledge gained from racing simulators into real-life racing experiences, which I hope will be soon!

Music also plays a big part in my life, serving as both inspiration and a way to unwind from the technical world.
